# IPPM20_tutorial

Simple tutorial on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn. 
The goal is to get basic understanding of various techniques.


## Tools

Install Anaconda or miniconda or using google Colab


## Description

I use the "Wisconsin Breast Cancer" which is a default, preprocessed and cleaned datasets comes with scikit-learn. The target is to classify tumor as 'malignant' or 'benign' and code is written in Python using Jupyter notebook (CancerML.ipynb)

Techniques:
* KNN
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forests
* Neural Network
