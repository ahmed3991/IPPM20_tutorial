To install Environment in Conda tap `conda env create -f myenv.yml`


## Description

#### Part1:Breast Cancer Classification
I use the "Wisconsin Breast Cancer" which is a default, preprocessed and cleaned datasets comes with scikit-learn. The target is to classify tumor as 'malignant' or 'benign' and code is written in Python using Jupyter notebook.

Techniques:
* KNN
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forests
* Neural Network
* and SVM

#### Part2:Fashion MNIST in Keras

Using neural networks to identify clothing items!

In this project, we will demonstrate how to use the Keras neural network library to perform image classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset from Zalando. We will initially demonstrate how we can use a multilayer perceptron model to achieve 89.65% accuracy on the test set.

The project was based off of the Keras MNIST tutorial by wxs.
